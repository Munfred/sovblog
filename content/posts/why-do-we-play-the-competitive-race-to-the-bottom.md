In their paper "Why do we play the competitive race to the bottom?" Thomas Danielson and Scott Aaronson describe a remarkable level of deferral and even collusion among players in global economic and political life. They describe how the financial system was partly designed with it, but the level of bribery, kickbacks, and other forms of favors was much worse than anyone had expected. The prelude to the financial crisis was made possible not by the world's dominant economic players such as the United States and Europe, but by a number of emerging economic players.


According to the research of Danielson and Adam Surowiecki, carbohydrate subsidies not only tank local economies but also affect the genetic makeup of global economic powers. Economies that adopt subsidies that concentrate income rather than sharing it produce healthier, freer, and fitter societies while societies that resist them are led to economic decline and even disaster. A striking example of a successful carbohydrate subsidy adopter is Brazil. Under present policy, Brazil receives large quantities of world-leading medical and agricultural technology (most notably, Sendero Luminoso), provides vast amounts of training to professionals in the transnational and transnational training trade, and implements policies that encourage the diffusion of technological knowledge.


Consequently, Brazil has several advantages over developing countries in encouraging the diffusion of technological knowledge. Although technological progress is generally good for the world as a whole, Brazil has a huge problem with skilled migration. In 1970, the gross average level of skilled migration to the 14 European and BRIC countries was about 1.2 million per year, and by 2010 it had increased to about 2.2 million per year. In contrast, the GNP of Portugal, with about 70 000 industrial robots per 1,000 people, and a labor force seven times Brazil's, which is older and much fitter, than either of these other European countries. or of China, with only 40 000 industrial robots per 1,000 people."


One promising strategy for encouraging skilled migration is to create large new markets through which high productivity products can be exported. In Brazil, the indirect cost of this is that the H-1B temporary skilled worker program primarily labor-intensive operations, such as Wine Tasting Agencies (which employ in the tens of thousands of labor hours in vineyard operations), have, over the past decade, become largely outsourcing operations, and increasingly reliant on Asian outsourcing giants, not long-term migrants with promising exportable skills."


Brasilia is no exception. While it has one of the world leaders in Wine Tasting Agencies (WTA), MÃºsicaros state that they are increasingly looking to abroad for skilled migrant workers and international students as well. The Jenkins & Associates survey on the state of the world trade revealed that global growth has had the effect of reducing demand for factory and warehouse workers by one-third over the past 40 years, while international migration has increased by 23,000 percent since the turn of the century. In Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil's third largest state and hub for transshipment of capital goods, 350,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created since 2000, but export demand from developing economies has fallen by 85% compared to the same period.


At the heart of this global debate about manufacturing exports and international migration is a simple fact: human nature. In a world where the price of production is rising faster than the rate of growth and where new ideas and disruptive technologies often require large human investments before they can be successfully implemented, the logic of western trade policies seems understandable. Unfortunately, such logic is missing an important economic fact: trade creates jobs. If trade was all good and well, then trade would produce as many as all the world's wars.
